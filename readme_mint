Additional Notes and Best Practices
Email Configuration for Logwatch:

Action Required: Replace your_email@example.com in the Logwatch configuration section with a valid email address to receive daily log reports.
SSH Port Selection:

Recommendation: Choose an SSH port number that does not conflict with other services and is not easily guessable to enhance security.
Testing Environment:

Recommendation: Before deploying the script in a competition or production environment, test it in a controlled setting (e.g., a virtual machine) to ensure it behaves as expected without causing unintended disruptions.
Backup Critical Data:

Note: Although not included in this version of the script, it's crucial to back up important data and configuration files before making system-wide changes.
Regular Audits and Updates:

Recommendation: Periodically review and update the script to adapt to new security threats and ensure continued compliance with competition requirements.
Extensibility:

Potential Enhancements: Consider integrating additional security measures such as SELinux/AppArmor, two-factor authentication, or intrusion detection systems for an even more robust security posture.
